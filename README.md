# TechnicalOrientation
A repository for the technical_orientation at UVA

The Technical Orientation has three parts.
- Github
- Jupyter
- R

The most challenging of these three parts was the Jupyter section. While I had previously worked with _R_, I was not familiar with Jupyter. While I have done a decent amount of Python programming, I was not familiar with the matplot, pandas, or numpy libraries either.
